  Coding Challenge: "Event Scheduler Application" Objective: Develop a simple event scheduler application in Python. Deadline: Wednesday 3 April 2024 15:00 PM Description: The application should allow users to create, view, and delete events. Each event should have a title, description, date, and time. Users should be able to list all events and delete specific events by title. Requirements: Data Storage: Store events in a simple in-memory structure (e.g., a list or dictionary). No database or external file storage is required. Event Creation: Function to add a new event with title, description, date, and time. Validate that the date and time are in a proper format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD for date, HH:MM for time). Listing Events: Function to display all events, sorted by the date and time. Each event should display all its details. Deleting Events: Function to delete an event based on the title. If the event does not exist, display an appropriate message. User Interface: Simple text-based interface in the command line is sufficient. Provide options to create, view, and delete events. Evaluation Criteria: Code Quality: Readability, use of functions/classes, and adherence to Pythonic principles. Functionality: All features work as described. Error Handling: Gracefully handles invalid inputs and errors. Efficiency: Uses efficient algorithms and data structures where applicable. Submission: Submit the code as a GitHub repository link. Optional Advanced Features (for extra credit): Implement a simple search functionality to find events by date or keyword in the title/description. Add the ability to edit existing events. Implement basic unit tests for the application.
